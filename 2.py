# 2) [Programming] Palindrome refers to words that have the same results when
# we read from the beginning and read from the end, such as level, bob, and
# radar.
# Write a function that determines if the given word is palindrome or not.
# Display the results when you put two different words (one is palindrome and
# the other is not).
